# Dataset for Spatiotemporal Registration for Event-based Visual Odometry
The RobotEvt dataset contains sequences under different motion models, speeds and brightness from a static scene, specifically
 -  4 motion models: PureRot - pure rotation; ParRot partial rotation; PureTranslate - pure translation and FullMod - full rigid motion model.
- 3 speeds: Fast - maximum speed of the robot arm (1m/s); Mid - 75% of the maximum speed and Slow - 50% of the maximum speed.
- 2 brightness conditions: On and Off means bright and dark conditions, respectively.
