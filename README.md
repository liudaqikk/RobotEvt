# Dataset for Spatiotemporal Registration for Event-based Visual Odometry
The RobotEvt dataset contains sequences under different motion models, speeds and brightness from a static scene, specifically
 - 4 motion models: PureRot - pure rotation; ParRot partial rotation; PureTranslate - pure translation and FullMod - full rigid motion model.
- 3 speeds: Fast - maximum speed of the robot arm (1m/s); Mid - 75% of the maximum speed and Slow - 50% of the maximum speed.
- 2 brightness conditions: On and Off means bright and dark conditions, respectively.

This dataset were recored with a [DAVIS240C](https://inivation.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/DAVIS240.pdf), attatched on the endpoint of a UR5 robot arm. Ground truth were generated from the UR5 robot arm.
# Dataset format!
Events, raw images and IMU measurements are stored in the [rosbag](http://wiki.ros.org/rosbag) file.
- **dvs/events**: event information (timestamp x y polarity).
- **dvs/images**: raw images at fix rate.
- **dvs/imu**: IMU measurement at fix rate. 

Ground truth are provided with a txt file, where the poses are represented using rotation matrix and translation. One pose per line (timestamp r11 r12 r13 r21 r22 r23 r31 r32 r33 t1 t2 t3) .

# Download links
Download link for Pure Rotation sequences can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1uhnCR2iDIEZhVNmL-2a-FWmo1J-Ip_vv?usp=sharing), which contains the measurement of events, raw images and IMU. 
More sequences with full rigid motion and higher resolution generated using [Prophesee cameras](https://www.prophesee.ai/) will be released soon.
